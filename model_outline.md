# Climate Forecast of Water Levels

- Create cosine models using control watersheds by field season with precip as
either a predictor, or an intervention.  
- Determine drivers that control the above model parameters: SWE at certain
dates, fall rain, spring rain, melt timing, etc  
- Create model to predict parameters and find appriate distributions to describe
potential parameters  
- Evaluate model on control data and on pre-treatment treated sites
- Iterate above steps if necessary  
- Compare post-treatment data with modeled output using MCMC cosine trend
parameters and real precip  
- Create post-treatment models/parameter distributions similar to above  
- Find precip generation model and use MCMC to test many precip regimes against
observed data, using observed precip as a starting point.  
- Adjust precip generation model (or evaluate other datasets) as necessary to
pre and post treatment models with gernated precipitation matching known data  
- Generate future precip patterns in MCMC with cosine parameters adjusted
accordingly for reduced snowfall, increased precip, and increased T. This
should include lots of runs and should do pre and post-treatment separately
- Compare climate change impacts on forested and non-forested wetlands
