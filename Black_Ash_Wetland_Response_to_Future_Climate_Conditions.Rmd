Abstract
Future climate scenarios will likely lead to reduced connectivity between black
ash headwater wetlands and stream networks. 


## Black Ash Wetland Response to Future Climate Conditions

### Introduction
Shifts in temperature, and precipitation (timing, frequency, and quantity)
associated with climate change are already impacting global wetland ecology and
will intensify into the future [@burkett-2000;
@moomaw-2018]. In the Great Lakes region of North America (Figure
\@ref(fig:study-map)), summer precipitation is likely to decline while total
annual precipitation is expected to stay stable or increase [@byun-2018;
@hayhoe-2010]. These projected changes result in increased precipitation in the
spring and winter months. Winter precipitation will also experience a phase
change, seeing a reduction in the proportion of precipitation as snow and
increased occurrence of rain-on-snow melt events in the winter and spring
[@notaro-2015]. Taken together the shift in precipitation timing, the reduction
of total snowmelt, and an earlier snowmelt will reshape the annual hydrologic
budget. These changes will alter wetland hydroperiods, with water availability
increasing in the winter and spring and decreasing in the summer and early fall.
The impact of reduced water availability in the summer will be compounded by
increased evaporative demand [@byun-2018]. Summer temperatures are expected to
increase 2-8C&deg; [@byun-2018; @hayhoe-2010], which combined with decreased
summer precipitation will lead to more frequent drought conditions and increased
water stress on ecosystems.

Black ash (*Fraxinus nigra* Marsh) is an important hardwood component of many
forested wetlands in the northern United States and southern Canada. These
wetlands with a large or majority black ash component face the same climate
change impacts as other wetlands in the region. Additionally they face loss of
the major canopy species due to an invasive insect, Emerald Ash Borer (*Agrilus
planipennis* Fairmaire, EAB). Emerald ash borer was first found in the United
States in southeast Michigan in 2002 **CITATION**. It is known to infest and
cause high mortality in all ash native to North America **CITATION**. As of this
writing it is present in AAA US states and BBB Canadian provinces **CITATION**.
High mortality and the importance of ash in regional forested wetlands has led
to research on the impacts of their loss and strategies to mitigate those
impacts. @iverson-2016 evaluated the potential replacement species for black ash 
in the context of habitat availability, species migration, and replacement
species susceptibility to climate change impact, providing a useful resource for
climate-informed species replacements for black ash. However, black ash grows in
a range of geomorphic settings and local site conditions can have a strong
influence on hydrology, forest structure, and plant community among wetlands
[@kolka-2018]. Considering both @iverson-2016 and @kolka-2018 we can identify
four necessary components to evaluate mitigation efforts in black ash wetlands:
1) climate-informed species selection, 2) species tolerance of local site
conditions, 3) site conditions following EAB infestation, and 4) site conditions
in a future climate.

Researchers in Michigan [@bolton-2018], Minnesota [@looney-2015], and Wisconsin
[@bolton-2018], have planted seedlings to evaluate potential canopy species at
the wetland rather than landscape level. The plantings in @bolton-2018 and
@looney-2015 took place under simulated EAB infestation, where the seedlings
were subjected to adverse conditions due to the hydrologic impact of the loss of
black ash [@slesak-2014; @vangrinsven-2017], as well as the increased
competition from herbaceous growth under increased light conditions
[@looney-2016; @looney-2017a; @davis-2017]. The work in Michigan and Minnesota
assessed mitigation in light of three of the four components of the combined
impact of climate change and EAB on black ash wetlands. The researchers selected
some species at the northern edge of their current range, evaluated them under
present-day site conditions, and under simulated-EAB site conditions. It is not
possible for the field studies to address the interaction of EAB and climate
change on site conditions. And just as we have seen EAB impacts cascade through
black ash ecosystems affecting hydrology, plant communities, and nutrient
cycling, we can expect the future climate-driven changes to hydrology to result
in similar cascades. Focusing on the future hydrologic characteristics of
these wetlands will inform us on the impacts to other functions, as hydrology is
the critical control on wetland ecosystems [@brinson-1993]. In order to understand
future hydrologic conditions we have derived wetland water level models to 
evaluate under future climate scenarios.

Simulated daily time-step weather conditions are available for various future
climate scenarios to serve as model inputs **CITATION**. However, previous
studies have demonstrated high-interannual variation in seasonal wetland water
level drawdown and rebound in black ash wetlands. Estimating the behavior of a
highly variable system with 30 years of daily climate projects could lead to
biased results and improper conclusions about the combined impacts of climate
change and EAB. A 30-year period provides a representation of normal climate
variation, but the weather sequences underlying a certain climate can take many
more forms than the observed (or simulated) 30 annual weather sequences.
Therefore, simulation studies of alternative scenarios or future conditions
require more weather sequences to quantify the most likely response and the
distribution of possible responses. Stochastic weather generators (SWGs) provide
a tool for generating synthetic time series of weather that simulate conditions
under an observed or projected climatology [@wilks-1999]. SWGs have also been
used as a downscaling technique for global or regional climate models
[@wilks-2012a; @wilks-2012b; @verdin-2015; @verdin-2019]. One class of SWG known
as Richardson [@wilks-2012b] are built from parametric representations fit to
climate conditions using multiple generalized linear models and varied
statistical distributions. This approach can be implemented using any observed
(or simulated) weather series that define particular climatic conditions. This
characteristic makes them well suited to compare multiple climate scenarios
without the overhead cost of executing complete GCM runs.

We have performed simulation experiments combining observed wetland hydrology
and synthetic weather sequences to quantify the interactions of EAB and future
climate scenarios. We developed wetland hydrology models for current canopy
conditions (ash-dominated forested wetlands), unforested conditions (herbaceous
and shrub/scrub wetlands), and potential future canopy conditions (forested
wetlands under current co-dominant species). We evaluated each class of model
under two potential future climate scenarios for the end of the 21st century
(2070-2099). The two future scenarios are defined by a less sensitive GCM
(projects smaller climate impacts) under the moderate relative concentration
pathway (RCP 4.5) , and a more sensitive GCM (projects larger climate impacts)
under the **_high_** relative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5)  **IPCC
CITATION**. The two-model ‘bookend’ approach provides a range of potential
future conditions as opposed to a multi-model ensemble approach which masks
some of the uncertainty in potential future conditions [@swanston-2016]. For an
unbiased comparison between current and future conditions both GCMs are used to
evaluate the wetland models under historic (1980-2009) climate conditions.

We expect that the interaction of hydrologic impacts of EAB and climate change
will result in a tempering of the two individual impacts in this region. While
simulation of post-EAB conditions have lead to increased water levels and
reduced drawdown rates in growing season, future climate conditions in the
region will result in reduced water availability during that same period. These
two opposing drivers should result in some moderation to both impacts.

### Methods

#### Study Area & Data

Wetland water levels measured at fourteen black ash-dominated wetlands in the
western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA were used to develop and evaluate our
wetland hydrologic models (Fig. \@ref(fig:study-map)). The wetlands range in
size from 0.29 to 1.19 ha and 30&ndash;80% of the basal area consists of black
ash with histosol soils over a confining layer located at an average depth of
118.8 cm [@davis-2017; @vangrinsven-2017]. The region has average minimum and
maximum annual temperatures of -11.3 &deg;C and 18.2 &deg;C and an average
annual precipitation of 101 cm for the climate period of 1980-2009 at the
Bergland Dam (46&deg;35'13"N, 89&deg;32'51"W) meteorological station
[@arguez-2012]. Wetland water levels were continuously monitored in 2"
inner-diameter driven wells from 2012-2020 and logged every fifteen minutes
using Solinst Levellogger Junior pressure transducers (Solinst, Ontario, CA),
with more details available in [@vangrinsven-2017]. Barometric compensation was
performed using data from Solinst Levellogger Junior pressure transducers
deployed at a subset of study wetlands. Compensated water levels were corrected
for temperature differentials as in Shannon, et al. Following an initial control
period of two growing seasons two-thirds of the wetlands were treated to
simulate the impacts of an EAB infestation. At one-third of the sites all ash
trees greater than 1" in diameter were girdled and at the other half of the
treatment sites all ash trees greater than 1" in diameter were hand-felled and
left on site.

Daily precipitation and daily minimum/maximum temperatures from existing
meteorological stations were used inputs to the wetland water level models
described below. From these input drivers we derived daily solar radiation, PET,
precipitation as snowfall and rain, and snowmelt. Precipitation records were
retrieved from the National Centers for Environmental Information Hourly
Precipitation Dataset [@hpdn] using the stations USC00201088 (Bruce Crossing,
MI), USC00204328 (Kenton, MI), USC00475352 (Mercer Ranger Station, WI),
USC00206215 (Ontonagon, MI), USC00476398 (Park Falls, WI), USC00476518 (Phelps,
WI), USC00476939 (Rainbow Reservoir Lake, Tomahawk, WI), USC00477140 (Rice
Reservoir, Tomahawk, WI), and USC00208680 (Watersmeet Fish Hatchery) and summed
to daily values. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures were taken from the
Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCND) dataset [@ghcnd; @menne-2012] for
the same stations, which were collocated HPD and GHCND sites. Where data were
missing, values were filled using inverse distance weighting with data retrieved
from the Mesowest [@horel-2002] network stations BPLM4 (Baraga Plains, MI),
KTNM4 (Kenton, MI), PIEM4 (Pelkie, MI), WKFM4 (Wakefield, MI), WMTM4
(Watersmeet, MI). Solar radiation data were also retrieved from the listed
Mesowest stations. The solar radiation and temperature data were used to fit the
Bristow-Campbell method coefficients to estimate solar radiation from latitude
and daily temperature range using the PIEM4 Mesowest site [@bristow-1984;
@bojanowski-2016]. Bristow-Campbell solar radiation was used to calculate
potential evapotranspiration (PET) via the modified Hargreaves-Samani equation
[@hargreaves-2003]. Precipitation was partitioned into snowfall, rain, and
snowmelt inputs using the CemaNeige snow accounting routine (SAR)
[@valery-2014b]. The CemaNeige SAR is temperature-index based and accounts for
accumulation, snowpack cold content, and snowmelt through a thermal state
weighting coefficient and a degree-day melt coefficient. The CemaNeige SAR is
implemented in the R package `airGR` [@coron-2017].

#### Wetland Hydrology Models
<!--
Attempted to weight log-likelihood in MLE with more weight given to less
frequently observed values. Having the mode of wetland water levels centered
around inundation leads to optimization that favors getting the flooded portion
correct. I would prefer to get drawdown correct and then flooded conditions
should follow. Performance did not improved.

Minimizing RSR did improve performance. Attempted to improve fit by converting
water level data to cumulative water level change rather than actual water
level. Thought this could help account for any discrepancy in well-height and
cable-length changes between growing seasons. Fit improved in some areas, but 
overall decrease in performance with some deceases drastic.
-->

The link between hydrology drivers (rainfall, snowmelt, PET) and daily water
level response has been shown to be non-linear and varying with stage
[@loheideii-2008; @white-1932]. In wetland systems the relationship between the
driver magnitude and response magnitude has been termed the ecosystem specific
yield (E~Sy~) [@mclaughlin-2014]. E~Sy~ has been empirically derived as the ratio
between precipitation inputs and water level rise ($\frac{P}{\Delta\;WL}$). The
relationship between empirical E~Sy~ and water level is modeled to provide a
continuous estimate of E~Sy~. Models fit to the E~Sy~\~Water Level relationship
include exponential [@mclaughlin-2014; @watras-2017], quadratic
[@mclaughlin-2014], and step-wise regression [@mclaughlin-2014]. This approach 
can be unworkable in the presence of confounding hydrologic variation such as
surface water connectivity and low-frequency seasonal changes in water 
availability [@watras-2017; @zhu-2011]. Similar to these studies our sites did
not show clear a relationship to E~Sy~ as defined above, requiring an 
alternative approach.

As an alternative we fit an inverse analog to $\frac{P}{\Delta\;WL}$. We began
by fitting a quadratic curve to the relationship between
a year-to-date water availability index from the beginning of the growing season to the point
of minimum wetland water level (Figure \@ref(fig:esy-function)), where

$$WA_{YTD}\;=\;P_{YTD} + M_{YTD} - PET_{YTD},$$  

$WA_{YTD}$, $P_{YTD}$, $M_{YTD}$, and $PET_{YTD}$ are year-to-date water
availability, rainfall, snow melt, and potential evapotranspiration,
respectively. Empirical E~Sy~ was then considered as the first derivative of the
quadratic curve, which has the form $\frac{\Delta\;WL}{\Delta\;WA}$. This
approach resulted in an asymptotic relationship between E~Sy~ and water level,
suggesting agreement with the exponential forms in
@mclaughlin-2014 and @watras-2017. Defining E~Sy~ as
$\frac{\Delta\;WL}{\Delta\;WA}$ provided additional information on the
relationship between E~Sy~ and water level as we were not limited to days with
rainfall. Models for E~Sy~ were fit using the year with the greatest water level
drawdown for each wetland to ensure the widest range of E~Sy~ variation. Each
wetland had the same basic form of E~Sy~ function. The functions were fit using
a single hierarchical model with each of the coefficients allowed to vary
independently within sites. Models were fit using the `brms` package in R
[@burkner-2017; @burkner-2018]. The asymptotic structure of the E~Sy~ function
requires that a lower bound be placed on E~Sy~ predictions to avoid values less
than or equal to zero. The minimum value of E~Sy~ was allowed to vary by wetland
and was fit along with other model parameters as described below.

```{r esy-function, fig.cap="Derivation of ecosystem specific yield for a single study wetland. Panel A shows the quadratic relationship between wetland water level and water balance (total liquid inputs minus potential evapotranspiration) for the drawdown period. Panel B shows the relationship between the derivative of the fitted line from Panel A, representing an emprical estimate of E~Sy~ and wetland water level."}

Wetland water levels were simulated on a continuous basis using daily inputs.
For each daily step wetland water level change was determined as a function of
the current water level, daily rainfall, daily PET, daily snowmelt, and
estimated streamflow (Equation EQAAA; Table \@ref(tab:parameter-table)). Maximum
wetland water levels for the control period were estimated as the mode of the
wetland water level record. Streamflow was assumed to occur whenever wetland
water levels were at or above the maximum water level. This is similar to the
approach in @mclaughlin-2019 where wetland surface water connectivity was
determined from wetland water level records. The current water level was used to
estimate $\hat_{E}~Sy~$ which was then used as a multiplier for rainfall, PET,
and snowmelt components. In addition each driver (R, PET, M, Q) had a best fit
coefficient (fitting described below). Snowmelt and precipitation were also fit
with a first order autoregressive filter to simulate slow flow contributions to
wetland water levels. Within a day only the larger of PET or P was used as
driver of water level change.

$$
\begin{align*}
& WL_{t+1} = WL_{t} + f_{E_{Sy}}(WL_{t-1})*(\hat{\beta}_DD + \hat{\beta}_MM) + \hat{\beta}_Q(WL_{t} - WL_{max})\\
& \hat{\beta}_DD\;=\left\{R \le PET;\;\;\hat{\beta}_{PET}PET\atop{R > PET; \;\; \hat{\beta}_RR}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\right.\\
& f_{E_{Sy}}(WL_{t-1})\;=\;a - (a - b) * e^{(c * WL_{t-1})} \\
& M_t = M_t + \phi_M\; M_{t-1} \\
& R_t = R_t + \phi_R\;R_{t-1}

Training data for wetland water level models was selected for each wetland as
the year with the greatest water level drawdown within the control period. The
remaining control-period years were used for wetland model evaluation. Wetland
parameters were estimated using minimize the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard
deviation of measured data (RSR) [@moriasi-2007]. To model impacted
wetlands that have not recovered to a fully forested state the observed
treatment data are used to reparameterize the model. Treatment-period training
data were also selected to maximize water level drawdown in the training set.
The wetland models were then reparameterized for the $\hat{\beta}_{PET}$,
$\hat{\beta}_{R}$, and $WL_{max}$ terms. Additionally we simulated reforested
black ash wetlands under future conditions assuming a mix of the current
co-dominant species, red maple and yellow birch. Future forested simulations
were performed using the same parameters as the control period with a reduction
of $\hat{\beta}_{PET}$. The reduction in $\hat{\beta}_{PET}$ is a function of
water level and current proportion of site basal area as black ash: 

$$\hat{\beta}_{PET-Adj} = \hat{\beta}_{PET}*[(1 - BA_{ash}) + BA_{ash} * [1.45077 - 0.05869 * (WL-WL_{max})]^{-1}]$$
This equation is derived from previous work showing a water level-depended
difference in sap flux between black ash and current co-dominant species
[@shannon-2018].

#### Future Climate Conditions
Wetland models were run under simulated current (1980-2009) and future
(2070-2099) conditions. Future conditions were evaluated under the RCP 4.5 and
RCP 8.5 representative concentration pathway scenarios. Daily climate
projections for all scenario-period combinations were taken from the localized
constructed analogs downscaling (LOCA) for the General Fluid Dynamics Lab
Coupled Model (GFDL-CM3) and National Center for Atmospheric Research Community
Earth System Model (CCSM4) global climate models (GCMS) [@pierce-2014;
@gent-2011; @griffies-2011]. LOCA downscaled data were retrieved from the
downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 Climate and Hydrology Projections archive
(http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/).

Performance of GCMs in the North American Great Lake region varies due to the
mostly unaccounted for regional climate impact of the Great Lakes [@notaro-2015;
@rood-2018]. GCM model selection was guided by performance and sensitivity
(magnitude of change under a given emissions scenario relative to other GCMs) of
the models in the Great Lakes region [@byun-2018]. Both GFDL-CM3 and CCSM4 were
found to be well performing models for the Great Lakes region, and CCSM4 and
GFDL-CM3 represent a less and more sensitive models, respectively. Inspection of
LOCA daily simulations of GFDL-CM3 and CCSM4 for the 1980-2009 period show
excellent alignment with observed conditions during the same period (Figure
\@ref(fig:gcm-evaluation)). Based on agreement between the LOCA and observed
datasets no bias-correction was performed. <!-- The combination of emission
scenarios and time periods results in six simulation periods (Table TABAAA),
each with 30 years of daily projections. -->

#### Stochastic Weather Generator  

**NEED TO LOOK AT APPLY A CUPOLA TO THE MULTIVARIATE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION.**
**I AM SEEING MORE EXTREME VALUES THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED. ALSO THESE ERRORS**
**ARE ON THE MONTHLY SCALE, WHICH I FOUND INTRODUCES MORE VARIANCE I CAN **
**PROBABLY GO BACK TO SEASONAL EVAL AND BE OKAY.**

The objective of projecting wetland conditions under future climate scenarios is
to understand the expected response, and the range of possible responses. The
30-year periods of daily projections provide a representation of the normal
climate variation under each scenario [@baddour-2007]. Quantifying the range of
weather patterns under future climate scenarios and the corresponding wetland
responses is best performed with many more years of simulation using stochastic
processes [@wilks-2012]. Stochastic weather generators (SWGs) are a tool for
generating synthetic time series of weather that simulate conditions under an
observed or projected climatology [@wilks-1999]. SWGs have also been used as a
downscaling technique for global or regional climate models [@verdin-2015;
@verdin-2019]. We followed the generalized linear model (GLM) based SWG
described in @verdin-2015, which is a type of the more general Richardson SWG 
[@richardson-1981].  

Our SWG consists of four GLM models to simulate precipitation occurrence,
precipitation amount, minimum daily temperature, and maximum daily temperature.
Minimum and maximum daily temperatures are fit using separate models with the
same model form. Each daily value is predicted using the previous day's minimum
and maximum temperatures, a pair of Fourier harmonics, and seasonal mean minimum
and maximum temperatures. To simulate the daily variation inherent within a
climate season additional error is added to the predicted daily minimum and
maximum temperatures. The additional error is drawn from a multivariate
skew-normal distribution conditioned on precipitation occurrence. This approach
captures the correlation between daily minimum and maximum temperatures and
between daily temperatres and precipitation occurrence. Precipitation occurrence
is modeled using the logistic family with a probit link function. Occurrence is
considered as a first order Markov process dependent upon the previous day's
precipitation occurrence [@wilks-1999]. Occurrence models also include a pair of
Fourier harmonics to capture any seasonality in precipitation patterns, and the
seasonal totals of precipitation for the observed period as covariates.
Precipitation amounts are drawn from a gamma distribution defined by shape and
scale parameters. The shape parameter is extracted from a gamma-family GLM with
a log link fit to the observed precipitation amounts. The predictors in the
model are a pair of Fourier harmonics and the seasonal precipitation totals. The
scale of gamma distribution describing the distribution of storm sizes is a
function of the scale and the predictors of the model. This approach allows the
storm distribution to vary temporally and capture seasonality in not only total
precipitation but also the size of the storms. When seasonal means and totals
are included as predictors within the GLM predictors it is said that the SWG is
conditioned on the observed climate. When applying a conditioned SWG to a new
climate projection it is assumed that the distribution of the precipitation
amounts will remain constant under the new seasonally-defined climate scenario
[@wilks-2012]. We removed this assumption from our analysis by developing
separate SWGs for each model-scenario combination using the LOCA daily
projections for GLM fitting.

The work in @verdin-2015 shows that these SWGs can capture and simulate
the spatial correlation in temperature and precipitation. We did not include
spatial correlation in our SWGs because of the relatively small size of the study
area and the fact that each wetland is considered an independent system. For
each model-scenario combination the SWG was fit using LOCA daily projections
from GHCN-D sites USC00200718, USC00206220, USC00204104, USC00476398,
USC00207812, USC00201088, USC00204328, USC00475352, USC00206215, USC00476398,
USC00476518, USC00476939, USC00477140, USC00208680 to calculate annual regional
seasonal precipitation temperature for conditioning data. The projected daily
data from the coordinates of the Bergland Dam meteorological station were used
to fit the SWG GLMs. Each SWG was used to simulate 10,000 individual weather
series with seasonal conditioning drawn randomly from the 30 years of projection
data. Conditioning the models on individual years of observed data will increase
interannual (or inter-simulation) variability, which can otherwise be limited in
SWGs [@wilks-1999].

<!-- 
It currently looks like the errors for the tmin and tmax models are too small 
when comparing the CDFs and PDFs of the SWG and LOCA tmin and tmax on a seasonal
basis. After some experimenting it looks like part of the problem might be that
the white noise added to the tmin/tmax simulations are from sd of monthly data,
which is smaller than sd of seasonal data. Using sd of seasonal data or
conditioning by month should solve this and get the KS tests to fail to reject
the NULL that the data are from the same distribution. Likely better errors 
could be computed using the skew_normal distribution. For JJA it looks like both
tmin and tmax have a negative skew that allows for almost perfect match with
PDF plot:
MASS::fitdistr(obs_data[gcm == "ccsm4" & scenario == "rcp45" & sample_season == "jja", tmin_c], dskew_normal, start = list(mu = 11, sigma = 4, alpha = -1), lower = list(mu = -Inf, sigma = .Machine$double.eps, alpha = -Inf))
The standard deviations of tmin and tmax may also vary with precip occurrence,
and SD of each of them would likely be related to each other. So the noise added
to the models should probably be mvrnorm() with a covariance matrix of tmin, tmax, 
and precip occurrence [@wilks-2012]

#### Data Analysis

##### Water Level Impacts
The distribution of modeled wetland water levels was evaluated for each
model-scenario combination. We compared the median and the highest density
interval for each combination. Additionally we compare the wetland water levels
along a gradient of simulated wetness based on synthetic precipitation. We
developed daily empirical cumulative density functions (ECDFs) for simulated
wetland water levels. Using these ECDFs we estimated the number of days water
levels were expected to be at certain critical levels. We chose to look at the
number of days water levels were within 10cm of the wetland surface, within 5 cm
of the control-condition wetland maximum water levels, and and more than
_**50cm**_ below the wetland surface. These levels represent wetland inundation,
important for vegetative cover, connectivity to the larger hydrologic surface
water network via streamflow and subsurface flow, and 'dry' conditions, 
representing periods where non-facultative wetland species could become 
established.

##### SWG Evaluation
Accuracy of the SWGs in representing the climatology of the model-scenario
combinations is critical to draw conclusions from the water level impacts.
Synthetic weather sets were compared on a seasonal basis to the daily LOCA
projections. For each season in each simulation the synthetic data were compare
to the LOCA daily projections for the same season using a two-sided
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine if the distributions of the datasets match.
A two-tailed *t*-test was also performed across the same partitioning to examine
if the means of the two datasets were not significantly different. We expected
to find that approximately 2000 of these comparisons would be determined to be
significantly different as we are testing with $\alpha=0.05$. By conditioning
the precipitation on the previous day's precipitation we could expect to find a
representation of wet and dry spell length and distribution [@wilks-1999]. As
the region has a relatively homogeneous distribution of precipitation without
regular prolonged wet and dry spells the SWG model outputs were not evaluated
for this variable.

### Results

#### Wetland Water Level Model Performance
Wetland water level model performance was evaluated using the median absolute
error and the modified index of agreement (D CITATION).

#### SWG Performance

Synthetic weather generator performance can be by comparing generated weather
sequences with the underlying observed/simulated climate data. The summary
statistics of the sequences should align well with underlying data and the
distribution of observed values should closely match the shape of the underlying
data [@gregory-1993]. When comparing all of the simulated SWG data (10000 years)
the mean values and interquartile ranges of daily minimum and maximum
temperature and precipitation align well with the LOCA-generated daily values
**FIG AAA**. There are more outliers observed in these data than in the LOCA
data because of quantity of observations. The LOCA data represents 30 years of
data compared to the 10,000 years of synthetic weather series. To compare the
distributions of the observed values we randomly sampled 30 sets of 30 years
from the observed 10,000 synthetic series. The distribution of these samples
were compared to the distribution of LOCA values. **Fig BBB** shows good
agreement for all seasons for daily minimum and maximum temperature. Monthly
precipitation totals are shown in **Fig BBB B**. Synthetic weather series show a
increased variability relative to LOCA values, but follows the same general
distribution.

#### Wetland Water Levels

Wetland water levels under future climate conditions were highly variable under
both scenarios and both vegetation types. Surface water occurred frequently
under all simulated conditions and scenarios  (FIG WATER LEVELS). Maximum
drawdown differed between future climate scenarios and vegetation conditions.
The less sensitive GCM under RCP 4.5 showed greater drawdown levels than the
more-sensitive GCM under RCP 8.5. Under both vegetation types, GFDL-CM3 (8.5)
conditions resulted in less variability than current ash forested conditions,
but more variability than the respective vegetation types under current climate
conditions (**FIG WATER LEVELS**). This increased variability was also observed
when analyzing the probability of critical water level thresholds.

###### Connecitivty

For replacement forested conditions the probability of connectivity to surface
water networks showed significant overlap with observed interannual variation
(FIG PROBABILITIES). For growing season months GFDL-CM3 (8.5) showed lower
median probability than observed conditions. These differences were greatest in
May and June. CCSM4 (4.5) simulations showed an earlier decline in water table
connectivity in June, with significant overlap with observed conditions.
Significant overlap occurs between the observed conditions and CCSM4 (4.5) for
the remainder of the growing season but the median response shows greater
connectivity between wetlands and surface water. For non-forested conditions
both less and more sensitive climate scenarios show reduced probability of
connectivity relative to current climate and forest conditions. The more
sensitive scenario shows little to no overlap with observed conditions while the
less sensitive scenario has lower median values, but significant overlap with
observed interannual variability.

##### Inundation

Inundation results closely resemble connectivity results however for all climate
scenarios and vegetation cover times probability of inundation was higher than
probability of connectivity. This is inline with fit model parameters that 
showed maximum sustained water levels were above the surface for almost every
wetland and treatment combination (**TABLE S1**). Under future forested 
conditions the more sensitive climate scenario shows similar probability of
inundation as observed variation with the exception of June when the probability
of inundation declined. Under the less sensitive climate scenario the 
probability of inundation increased in August and September while the other 
months showed median values with the range of observed variability. Under 
non-forested conditions the more sensitive climate scenario showed a lower 
probability of inundation starting in July and extending through October. The
less sensitive climate scenario showed that the probability of inundation was 
only slightly less than observed conditions for all growing season months with
the smallest difference in August.

##### Drawdown

Under both climate scenarios the future forest conditions showed a lower
probability of drawdown than was observed under the current ash forest.
Probability of drawdown was greater in the more sensitive scenario relative to
the less sensitive scenario and also more variable. Under the non-forest cover
and more sensitive scenario probability of drawdown was greater than observed
and greater than the less sensitive scenario. The less sensitve scenario had
a higher probability of drawdown conditions than observations, but 
showed overlap with interannual variation. 


<!-- in code/results_connectivity.R -->
'significant over lap between interannual variability' 'difference in the 


Late spring and summer simulations showed decreased probability of surface
water connectivity under all climate scenario and vegetation condition
combinations. Simulations under GFDL-CM3 (8.5) showed the earliest decrease in
probability of connectivity and followed by CCSM4 (4.5) and last current
conditions. Simulations under CCSM4 (4.5) consistently showed the lowest
probability of connectivity during the summer season (forested:, non-forested:
). Simulations under GFDL-CM3 (8.5) showed similar (non-forested) or increased (
forested) probability of connectivity relative to current conditions during the
summer season. Under replacement forest conditions CCSM4 (4.5) connectivity
closely matched current connectivity in the fall, while GFDL-CM3 (8.5)
connectivity was less than current conditions. Non-forested conditions showed
more variability in the probability of connectivity (wider 50% quantile
intervals) relative to the replacement forest conditions.

<!-- in code/results_inundation.R -->
Under both vegetation conditions the probability of surface inundation is least
under the CCSM4 (4.5) and greatest under current climate with GFDL-CM3 falling
between the other two scenarios. For replacement forests CCSM4 (4.5) the median
daily simulated probability of water levels within 10cm of the soil surface
drops to as low as 0.57 during the peak of the growing season. Minimum median
daily simulated probability of water levels within 10cm of the soil surface was
0.75 under GFDL-CM3 (8.5) and 0.84 under historical climate conditions. Under
replacement forests and all climate scenarios water was more likely to be
present close to the surface relative to current ash forest conditions. Early
season drawdown may result in less surface water under the more senstive climate
scenario. For non-forested conditions the climate scenarios fell in the same
order with more separation between scenarios. The minimum median simulated
probability of water levels within 10cm of the soil surface was 0.70, 0.57, 0.38
for current climate, GFDL-CM3 (8.5), and CCSM4 (4.5) respectively. Here we see
similar probability of near-surface water under CCSM4 (4.5) relative to current
ash forest conditions. Early season drawdown may lead to lower early growing
season water levels under GFDL-CM3 (8.5). Surface water was found to be less
likely in the fall under GFDL-CM3 (8.5) and CCSM4 (4.5).

### Discussion

For non-forested sites water level rebound and recharge would be reliant on 
dormant season precipitation.

Earlier decrease in early growing season is from earlier snowmelt (check but
I think CN did not do a great job adjusting to a smaller snowmelt)

Under all vegetation/indicator combinations more and less sensitive scenarios
showed the same trend, drier conditions under more sensitive.

Increased variability in GFDL-CM3 (8.5) relative to observed conditions w/r/t
future forested inundation could be explained simply by number of observations.
Control model under future climates would help by showing if variability is high
for ash forests under future climate conditions

Relate future simulations to 'normal' years now. For instance non-forested less
sensitve scenario: A 'wet' year under those conditions and scenario will be 
similar to a somehwat 'dry' year now.

Use current climate simulations under both veg types to evlauate role of climate
conditions vs role of veg cover. If ash-forest conditions and historical climate
simulations are similar it means climate is the main control, where they differ
it means veg conditions are important. Also compare climate scenarios across the
cover types: are the probability patterns about the same within a climate 
scenario? If so then it means climate is controlling that response and when 
there are differences within a climate scenario we can assume cover type is the
control

There are similar pattern,s, but some distinctions between connectivity and 
inundation probabilities that may be important enough to note. Less uncertainty
regarding connectivity relative to inundation. More separation between climate
scenarios for connectivity

Compare with CCSM-4 RCP8.5 and GFDL-CM3 RCP4.5

Discuss bigger picture questions with @moomaw-2018, 

Consistency between the observation period used to train wetland water level
models and future climate predictions is critical to draw meaningful
conclusions. This is why we chose to use external meterologic data to develop
our wetland models.

The high interannual variability of these systems does not show much
differentiation between climate scenarios and vegetation conditions. Examining
the probability of occurrence of certain threshold water levels does show
differentiation between climate scenarios and vegetation conditions.

It is critical to capture full range of water levels in E~Sy~ calculations. Testing
at 152 shows that we get poorer performance of ET vs PET when doing diurnal 
signal separation with 2018 data vs the 2012 E~Sy~

Decadal oscillations from @watras-2014 illustrate more potential sources of 
variation

Only using a single year of simulation, missing long terms droughts and wet 
spells. Do not have the training data to compare, and assuming wetland recharge
will happen each time since we aren't predicted for winter droughts. Perhaps it
would be worth looking at 30 year chunks of simulations for multiyear drought
presence

Get at drivers of different responses. Is it increase/decrease in P, increase in
PET or decrease in AET that's driving these results?

#### Species selection
Use hydrograph results to reexaming list from Iverson and results from Looney &
Bolton to see if any of the recommendations hold true, or if any new species
could be considered depending on the simulation results

#### Rain on Snow
Rain on snow melt can increase melt timing and result in reduced groundwater
recharge, which will likely impact the immediacy of wetland water level drawdown.
Idea from Meyers H028-07 AGU 2020

Each wetland is being considered individually so it is not necessary to use a GLM that accounts for spatial correlation between observed conditions. To expand this work to an assessment of the impact of EAB on regional hydrology would require the GLM treat the region as a single system and capture spatial trends in weather conditions.

RCP8.5 may not be a likely worst case scenario any more [@harvey-2020; @hausfather-2020]
