Abstract
Future climate scenarios will likely lead to reduced connectivity between black
ash headwater wetlands and stream networks. 


## Black Ash Wetland Response to Future Climate Conditions

### Introduction
Shifts in temperature, and precipitation (timing, frequency, and quantity)
associated with climate change are already impacting global wetland ecology and
will intensify into the future [@burkett-2000;
@moomaw-2018]. 
**Rework this to discuss model ranges. GDFL shows wetter, hotter summer (https://climatetoolbox.org/tool/Climate-Mapper)**
*The Byun and Hayhoe results are for ensembles and there are differences between the models and scenarios*
In the Great Lakes region of North America (Figure
\@ref(fig:study-map)), summer precipitation is likely to decline while total
annual precipitation is expected to stay stable or increase [@byun-2018;
@hayhoe-2010]. These projected changes result in increased precipitation in the
spring and winter months. Winter precipitation will also experience a phase
change, seeing a reduction in the proportion of precipitation as snow and
increased occurrence of rain-on-snow melt events in the winter and spring
[@notaro-2015]. Taken together the shift in precipitation timing, the reduction
of total snowmelt, and an earlier snowmelt will reshape the annual hydrologic
budget. These changes will alter wetland hydroperiods, with water availability
increasing in the winter and spring and decreasing in the summer and early fall.
The impact of reduced water availability in the summer will be compounded by
increased evaporative demand [@byun-2018]. Summer temperatures are expected to
increase 2-8C&deg; [@byun-2018; @hayhoe-2010], which combined with decreased
summer precipitation will lead to more frequent drought conditions and increased
water stress on ecosystems.

Black ash (*Fraxinus nigra* Marsh) is an important hardwood component of many
forested wetlands in the northern United States and southern Canada. These
wetlands with a large or majority black ash component face the same climate
change impacts as other wetlands in the region. Additionally they face loss of
the major canopy species due to an invasive insect, Emerald Ash Borer (*Agrilus
planipennis* Fairmaire, EAB). Emerald ash borer was first found in the United
States in southeast Michigan in 2002 **CITATION**. It is known to infest and
cause high mortality in all ash native to North America **CITATION**. As of this
writing it is present in AAA US states and BBB Canadian provinces **CITATION**.
High mortality and the importance of ash in regional forested wetlands has led
to research on the impacts of their loss and strategies to mitigate those
impacts. @iverson-2016 evaluated the potential replacement species for black ash 
in the context of habitat availability, species migration, and replacement
species susceptibility to climate change impact, providing a useful resource for
climate-informed species replacements for black ash. However, black ash grows in
a range of geomorphic settings and local site conditions can have a strong
influence on hydrology, forest structure, and plant community among wetlands
[@kolka-2018]. Considering both @iverson-2016 and @kolka-2018 we can identify
four necessary components to evaluate mitigation efforts in black ash wetlands:
1) climate-informed species selection, 2) species tolerance of local site
conditions, 3) site conditions following EAB infestation, and 4) site conditions
in a future climate.

Researchers in Michigan [@bolton-2018], Minnesota [@looney-2015], and Wisconsin
[@bolton-2018], have planted seedlings to evaluate potential canopy species at
the wetland rather than landscape level. The plantings in @bolton-2018 and
@looney-2015 took place under simulated EAB infestation, where the seedlings
were subjected to adverse conditions due to the hydrologic impact of the loss of
black ash [@slesak-2014; @vangrinsven-2017], as well as the increased
competition from herbaceous growth under increased light conditions
[@looney-2016; @looney-2017a; @davis-2017]. The work in Michigan and Minnesota
assessed mitigation in light of three of the four components of the combined
impact of climate change and EAB on black ash wetlands. The researchers selected
some species at the northern edge of their current range, evaluated them under
present-day site conditions, and under simulated-EAB site conditions. It is not
possible for the field studies to address the interaction of EAB and climate
change on site conditions. And just as we have seen EAB impacts cascade through
black ash ecosystems affecting hydrology, plant communities, and nutrient
cycling, we can expect the future climate-driven changes to hydrology to result
in similar cascades. Focusing on the future hydrologic characteristics of
these wetlands will inform us on the impacts to other functions, as hydrology is
the critical control on wetland ecosystems [@brinson-1993]. In order to understand
future hydrologic conditions we have derived wetland water level models to 
evaluate under future climate scenarios.

Simulated daily time-step weather conditions are available for various future
climate scenarios to serve as model inputs **CITATION**. However, previous
studies have demonstrated high-interannual variation in seasonal wetland water
level drawdown and rebound in black ash wetlands. Estimating the behavior of a
highly variable system with 30 years of daily climate projects could lead to
biased results and improper conclusions about the combined impacts of climate
change and EAB. A 30-year period provides a representation of normal climate
variation, but the weather sequences underlying a certain climate can take many
more forms than the observed (or simulated) 30 annual weather sequences.
Therefore, simulation studies of alternative scenarios or future conditions
require more weather sequences to quantify the most likely response and the
distribution of possible responses. Stochastic weather generators (SWGs) provide
a tool for generating synthetic time series of weather that simulate conditions
under an observed or projected climatology [@wilks-1999]. SWGs have also been
used as a downscaling technique for global or regional climate models
[@wilks-2012; @verdin-2015; @verdin-2019]. One class of SWG known
as Richardson [@wilks-2012] are built from parametric representations fit to
climate conditions using multiple generalized linear models and varied
statistical distributions. This approach can be implemented using any observed
(or simulated) weather series that define particular climatic conditions. This
characteristic makes them well suited to compare multiple climate scenarios
without the overhead cost of executing complete GCM runs.

We have performed simulation experiments combining observed wetland hydrology
and synthetic weather sequences to quantify the interactions of EAB and future
climate scenarios. We developed wetland hydrology models for current canopy
conditions (ash-dominated forested wetlands), non-forested conditions (herbaceous
and shrub/scrub wetlands), and potential future canopy conditions (forested
wetlands under current co-dominant species). We evaluated each class of model
under two potential future climate scenarios for the end of the 21st century
(2070-2099). The two future scenarios are defined by a less sensitive GCM
(projects smaller climate impacts) under the moderate relative concentration
pathway (RCP 4.5) , and a more sensitive GCM (projects larger climate impacts)
under the **_high_** relative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5)  **IPCC
CITATION**. The two-model ‘bookend’ approach provides a range of potential
future conditions as opposed to a multi-model ensemble approach which masks
some of the uncertainty in potential future conditions [@swanston-2016]. For an
unbiased comparison between current and future conditions both GCMs are used to
evaluate the wetland models under historic (1980-2009) climate conditions.

We expect that the interaction of hydrologic impacts of EAB and climate change
will result in a tempering of the two individual impacts in this region. While
simulation of post-EAB conditions have lead to increased water levels and
reduced drawdown rates in growing season, future climate conditions in the
region will result in reduced water availability during that same period. These
two opposing drivers should result in some moderation to both impacts.

### Methods

#### Study Area & Data

Wetland water levels measured at fourteen black ash-dominated wetlands in the
western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA were used to develop and evaluate our
wetland hydrologic models (Fig. \@ref(fig:study-map)). The wetlands range in
size from 0.29 to 1.19 ha and 30&ndash;80% of the basal area consists of black
ash with histosol soils over a confining layer located at an average depth of
118.8 cm [@davis-2017; @vangrinsven-2017]. The region has average minimum and
maximum annual temperatures of -11.3 &deg;C and 18.2 &deg;C and an average
annual precipitation of 101 cm for the climate period of 1980-2009 at the
Bergland Dam (46&deg;35'13"N, 89&deg;32'51"W) meteorological station
[@arguez-2012]. Wetland water levels were continuously monitored in 2"
inner-diameter driven wells from 2012-2020 and logged every fifteen minutes
using Solinst Levellogger Junior pressure transducers (Solinst, Ontario, CA),
with more details available in [@vangrinsven-2017]. Barometric compensation was
performed using data from Solinst Levellogger Junior pressure transducers
deployed at a subset of study wetlands. Compensated water levels were corrected
for temperature differentials as in Shannon, et al. Following an initial control
period of two growing seasons two-thirds of the wetlands were treated to
simulate the impacts of an EAB infestation. At one-third of the sites all ash
trees greater than 1" in diameter were girdled and at the other half of the
treatment sites all ash trees greater than 1" in diameter were hand-felled and
left on site.

Daily precipitation and daily minimum/maximum temperatures from existing
meteorological stations were used inputs to the wetland water level models
described below. From these input drivers we derived daily solar radiation, PET,
precipitation as snowfall and rain, and snowmelt. Precipitation records were
retrieved from the National Centers for Environmental Information Hourly
Precipitation Dataset [@hpdn] using the stations USC00201088 (Bruce Crossing,
MI), USC00204328 (Kenton, MI), USC00475352 (Mercer Ranger Station, WI),
USC00206215 (Ontonagon, MI), USC00476398 (Park Falls, WI), USC00476518 (Phelps,
WI), USC00476939 (Rainbow Reservoir Lake, Tomahawk, WI), USC00477140 (Rice
Reservoir, Tomahawk, WI), and USC00208680 (Watersmeet Fish Hatchery) and summed
to daily values. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures were taken from the
Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCND) dataset [@ghcnd; @menne-2012] for
the same stations, which were collocated HPD and GHCND sites. Where data were
missing, values were filled using inverse distance weighting with data retrieved
from the Mesowest [@horel-2002] network stations BPLM4 (Baraga Plains, MI),
KTNM4 (Kenton, MI), PIEM4 (Pelkie, MI), WKFM4 (Wakefield, MI), WMTM4
(Watersmeet, MI). Solar radiation data were also retrieved from the listed
Mesowest stations. The solar radiation and temperature data were used to fit the
Bristow-Campbell method coefficients to estimate solar radiation from latitude
and daily temperature range using the PIEM4 Mesowest site [@bristow-1984;
@bojanowski-2016]. Bristow-Campbell solar radiation was used to calculate
potential evapotranspiration (PET) via the modified Hargreaves-Samani equation
[@hargreaves-2003]. Precipitation was partitioned into snowfall, rain, and
snowmelt inputs using the CemaNeige snow accounting routine (SAR)
[@valery-2014b]. The CemaNeige SAR is temperature-index based and accounts for
accumulation, snowpack cold content, and snowmelt through a thermal state
weighting coefficient and a degree-day melt coefficient. The CemaNeige SAR is
implemented in the R package `airGR` [@coron-2017].

#### Wetland Hydrology Models
<!--
Attempted to weight log-likelihood in MLE with more weight given to less
frequently observed values. Having the mode of wetland water levels centered
around inundation leads to optimization that favors getting the flooded portion
correct. I would prefer to get drawdown correct and then flooded conditions
should follow. Performance did not improved.

Minimizing RSR did improve performance. Attempted to improve fit by converting
water level data to cumulative water level change rather than actual water
level. Thought this could help account for any discrepancy in well-height and
cable-length changes between growing seasons. Fit improved in some areas, but 
overall decrease in performance with some deceases drastic.
-->

The link between hydrology drivers (rainfall, snowmelt, PET) and daily water
level response has been shown to be non-linear and varying with stage
[@loheideii-2008; @white-1932]. In wetland systems the relationship between the
driver magnitude and response magnitude has been termed the ecosystem specific
yield (E~Sy~) [@mclaughlin-2014] (see **Section #### in Chapter #### on Pressure
Transducer Uncertainty for more information about the development of E~Sy~ over
time**). E~Sy~ has been empirically derived as the ratio between precipitation
inputs and water level rise ($\frac{P}{\Delta\;WL}$). The relationship between
empirical E~Sy~ and water level is modeled to provide a continuous estimate of
E~Sy~. Models fit to the E~Sy~\~Water Level relationship include exponential
[@mclaughlin-2014; @watras-2017], quadratic [@mclaughlin-2014], and step-wise
regression [@mclaughlin-2014]. This approach can be unworkable in the presence
of confounding hydrologic variation such as surface water connectivity and
low-frequency seasonal changes in water availability [@watras-2017; @zhu-2011].
Similar to these studies our sites did not show clear a relationship to E~Sy~ as
defined above, requiring an alternative approach.

As an alternative we fit an inverse analog to $\frac{P}{\Delta\;WL}$. We began
by fitting a quadratic curve to the relationship between
a year-to-date water availability index from the beginning of the growing season to the point
of minimum wetland water level (Figure \@ref(fig:esy-function)), where

$$WA_{YTD}\;=\;P_{YTD} + M_{YTD} - PET_{YTD},$$  

$WA_{YTD}$, $P_{YTD}$, $M_{YTD}$, and $PET_{YTD}$ are year-to-date water
availability, rainfall, snow melt, and potential evapotranspiration,
respectively. Empirical E~Sy~ was then considered as the first derivative of the
quadratic curve, which has the form $\frac{\Delta\;WL}{\Delta\;WA}$. This
approach resulted in an asymptotic relationship between E~Sy~ and water level,
suggesting agreement with the exponential forms in
@mclaughlin-2014 and @watras-2017. Defining E~Sy~ as
$\frac{\Delta\;WL}{\Delta\;WA}$ provided additional information on the
relationship between E~Sy~ and water level as we were not limited to days with
rainfall. Models for E~Sy~ were fit using the year with the greatest water level
drawdown for each wetland to ensure the widest range of E~Sy~ variation. Each
wetland had the same basic form of E~Sy~ function. The functions were fit using
a single hierarchical model with each of the coefficients allowed to vary
independently within sites. Models were fit using the `brms` package in R
[@burkner-2017; @burkner-2018]. The asymptotic structure of the E~Sy~ function
requires that a lower bound be placed on E~Sy~ predictions to avoid values less
than or equal to zero. The minimum value of E~Sy~ was allowed to vary by wetland
and was fit along with other model parameters as described below.

```{r esy-function, fig.cap="Derivation of ecosystem specific yield for a single study wetland. Panel A shows the quadratic relationship between wetland water level and water balance (total liquid inputs minus potential evapotranspiration) for the drawdown period. Panel B shows the relationship between the derivative of the fitted line from Panel A, representing an emprical estimate of E~Sy~ and wetland water level."}

Wetland water levels were simulated on a continuous basis using daily inputs.
For each daily step wetland water level change was determined as a function of
the current water level, daily rainfall, daily PET, daily snowmelt, and
estimated streamflow (Equation EQAAA; Table \@ref(tab:parameter-table)). Maximum
wetland water levels for the control period were estimated as the mode of the
wetland water level record. Streamflow was assumed to occur whenever wetland
water levels were at or above the maximum water level. This is similar to the
approach in @mclaughlin-2019 where wetland surface water connectivity was
determined from wetland water level records. The current water level was used to
estimate $\hat_{E}~Sy~$ which was then used as a multiplier for rainfall, PET,
and snowmelt components. In addition each driver (R, PET, M, Q) had a best fit
coefficient (fitting described below). Snowmelt and precipitation were also fit
with a first order autoregressive filter to simulate slow flow contributions to
wetland water levels. Within a day only the larger of PET or P was used as
driver of water level change.

$$
\begin{align*}
& WL_{t+1} = WL_{t} + f_{E_{Sy}}(WL_{t-1})*(\hat{\beta}_DD + \hat{\beta}_MM) + \hat{\beta}_Q(WL_{t} - WL_{max})\\
& \hat{\beta}_DD\;=\left\{R \le PET;\;\;\hat{\beta}_{PET}PET\atop{R > PET; \;\; \hat{\beta}_RR}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\right.\\
& f_{E_{Sy}}(WL_{t-1})\;=\;a - (a - b) * e^{(c * WL_{t-1})} \\

Training data for wetland water level models was selected for each wetland as
the year with the greatest water level drawdown within the control period. The
remaining control-period years were used for wetland model evaluation. Wetland
parameters were estimated using minimize the weighted root-mean square error of
the predictions. Weights were applied asymmetrically where days with
observed water levels greater than or equal to *WL<sub>max</sub>* were assigned 
the original equal weight (1/n). As observed water levels decreased below
*WL<sub>max</sub>* weights increased as the square of the difference between
observed water level and *WL<sub>max</sub>*. To model impacted
wetlands that have not recovered to a fully forested state the observed
treatment data are used to reparameterize the model. Treatment-period training
data were also selected to maximize water level drawdown in the training set.
The wetland models were then reparameterized for the $\hat{\beta}_{PET}$,
$\hat{\beta}_{R}$, and $WL_{max}$ terms. Additionally we simulated reforested
black ash wetlands under future conditions assuming a mix of the current
co-dominant species, red maple and yellow birch. Future forested simulations
were performed using the same parameters as the control period with a reduction
of $\hat{\beta}_{PET}$. The reduction in $\hat{\beta}_{PET}$ is a function of
water level and current proportion of site basal area as black ash: 

$$\hat{\beta}_{PET-Adj} = \hat{\beta}_{PET}*[(1 - BA_{ash}) + BA_{ash} * [1.45077 - 0.05869 * (WL-WL_{max})]^{-1}]$$
This equation is derived from previous work showing a water level-depended
difference in sap flux between black ash and current co-dominant species
[@shannon-2018].

#### Future Climate Conditions
**GDFL-CM3 is more sensitive model, leading to hotter, wetter conditions**
Wetland models were run under simulated current (1980-2009) and future
(2070-2099) conditions. Future conditions were evaluated under the RCP 4.5 and
RCP 8.5 representative concentration pathway scenarios. Daily climate
projections for all scenario-period combinations were taken from the localized
constructed analogs downscaling (LOCA) for the General Fluid Dynamics Lab
Coupled Model (GFDL-CM3) and National Center for Atmospheric Research Community
Earth System Model (CCSM4) global climate models (GCMS) [@pierce-2014;
@gent-2011; @griffies-2011]. LOCA downscaled data were retrieved from the
downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 Climate and Hydrology Projections archive
(http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/).

Performance of GCMs in the North American Great Lake region varies due to the
mostly unaccounted for regional climate impact of the Great Lakes [@notaro-2015;
@rood-2018]. GCM model selection was guided by performance and sensitivity
(magnitude of change under a given emissions scenario relative to other GCMs) of
the models in the Great Lakes region [@byun-2018]. Both GFDL-CM3 and CCSM4 were
found to be well performing models for the Great Lakes region, and CCSM4 and
GFDL-CM3 represent a less and more sensitive models, respectively. Inspection of
LOCA daily simulations of GFDL-CM3 and CCSM4 for the 1980-2009 period show
excellent alignment with observed conditions during the same period (Figure
\@ref(fig:gcm-evaluation)). Monthly and seasonal precipitation totals showed 
good agreement between the LOCA and observed datasets and no bias-correction was 
performed.

#### Stochastic Weather Generator  

The objective of projecting wetland conditions under future climate scenarios is
to understand the expected response, and the range of possible responses. The
30-year periods of daily projections provide a representation of the normal
climate variation under each scenario [@baddour-2007]. Quantifying the range of
weather patterns under future climate scenarios and the corresponding wetland
responses is best performed with many more years of simulation using stochastic
processes [@wilks-2012]. Stochastic weather generators (SWGs) are a tool for
generating synthetic time series of weather that simulate conditions under an
observed or projected climatology [@wilks-1999]. SWGs have also been used as a
downscaling technique for global or regional climate models [@verdin-2015;
@verdin-2019]. We followed the generalized linear model (GLM) based SWG
described in @verdin-2015, which is a type of the more general Richardson SWG 
[@richardson-1981].  

Our SWG consists of four GLM models to simulate precipitation occurrence,
precipitation amount, minimum daily temperature, and maximum daily temperature.
Minimum and maximum daily temperatures are fit using separate models with the
same model form. Each daily value is predicted using the previous day's minimum
and maximum temperatures, a pair of Fourier harmonics, and seasonal mean minimum
and maximum temperatures. To simulate the daily variation inherent within a
climate season additional error is added to the predicted daily minimum and
maximum temperatures. The additional error is drawn from a multivariate
skew-normal distribution conditioned on precipitation occurrence. This approach
captures the correlation between daily minimum and maximum temperatures and
between daily temperatres and precipitation occurrence. Precipitation occurrence
is modeled using the logistic family with a probit link function. Occurrence is
considered as a first order Markov process dependent upon the previous day's
precipitation occurrence [@wilks-1999]. Occurrence models also include a pair of
Fourier harmonics to capture any seasonality in precipitation patterns, and the
seasonal totals of precipitation for the observed period as covariates.
Precipitation amounts are drawn from a gamma distribution defined by shape and
scale parameters. The shape parameter is extracted from a gamma-family GLM with
a log link fit to the observed precipitation amounts. The predictors in the
model are a pair of Fourier harmonics and the seasonal precipitation totals. The
scale of gamma distribution describing the distribution of storm sizes is a
function of the scale and the predictors of the model. This approach allows the
storm distribution to vary temporally and capture seasonality in not only total
precipitation but also the size of the storms. When seasonal means and totals
are included as predictors within the GLM predictors it is said that the SWG is
conditioned on the observed climate. When applying a conditioned SWG to a new
climate projection it is assumed that the distribution of the precipitation
amounts will remain constant under the new seasonally-defined climate scenario
[@wilks-2012]. We removed this assumption from our analysis by developing
separate SWGs for each model-scenario combination using the LOCA daily
projections for GLM fitting.

The work in @verdin-2015 shows that these SWGs can capture and simulate
the spatial correlation in temperature and precipitation. We did not include
spatial correlation in our SWGs because of the relatively small size of the study
area and the fact that each wetland is considered an independent system. For
each model-scenario combination the SWG was fit using LOCA daily projections
from GHCN-D sites USC00200718, USC00206220, USC00204104, USC00476398,
USC00207812, USC00201088, USC00204328, USC00475352, USC00206215, USC00476398,
USC00476518, USC00476939, USC00477140, USC00208680 to calculate annual regional
seasonal precipitation temperature for conditioning data. The projected daily
data from the coordinates of the Bergland Dam meteorological station were used
to fit the SWG GLMs. Each SWG was used to simulate 10,000 individual weather
series with seasonal conditioning drawn randomly from the 30 years of projection
data. Conditioning the models on individual years of observed data will increase
interannual (or inter-simulation) variability, which can otherwise be limited in
SWGs [@wilks-1999].

<!-- 
It currently looks like the errors for the tmin and tmax models are too small 
when comparing the CDFs and PDFs of the SWG and LOCA tmin and tmax on a seasonal
basis. After some experimenting it looks like part of the problem might be that
the white noise added to the tmin/tmax simulations are from sd of monthly data,
which is smaller than sd of seasonal data. Using sd of seasonal data or
conditioning by month should solve this and get the KS tests to fail to reject
the NULL that the data are from the same distribution. Likely better errors 
could be computed using the skew_normal distribution. For JJA it looks like both
tmin and tmax have a negative skew that allows for almost perfect match with
PDF plot:
MASS::fitdistr(obs_data[gcm == "ccsm4" & scenario == "rcp45" & sample_season == "jja", tmin_c], dskew_normal, start = list(mu = 11, sigma = 4, alpha = -1), lower = list(mu = -Inf, sigma = .Machine$double.eps, alpha = -Inf))
The standard deviations of tmin and tmax may also vary with precip occurrence,
and SD of each of them would likely be related to each other. So the noise added
to the models should probably be mvrnorm() with a covariance matrix of tmin, tmax, 
and precip occurrence [@wilks-2012]

#### Data Analysis

##### Water Level Impacts
The distribution of modeled wetland water levels was evaluated for each
model-scenario combination. We compared the median and the highest density
interval for each combination. Additionally we compare the wetland water levels
along a gradient of simulated wetness based on synthetic precipitation. We
developed daily empirical cumulative density functions (ECDFs) for simulated
wetland water levels. Using these ECDFs we estimated the number of days water
levels were expected to be at certain critical levels. We chose to look at the
number of days water levels were within 10cm of the wetland surface, within 5 cm
of the control-condition wetland maximum water levels, and and more than
50 cm below the wetland surface. These levels represent wetland inundation,
important for vegetative cover, connectivity to the larger hydrologic surface
water network via streamflow and subsurface flow, and 'dry' conditions, 
representing periods where non-facultative wetland species could become 
established.

Consistency between the observation period used to train wetland water level
models and future climate predictions is critical to drawing meaningful
conclusions (**CITATION ABOUT FUTURE CLIMATE SCENRIO MODELING?**. We chose to
compare our future scenario modeling to a modeled control baseline. The modeled
control baseline was calculated using historical (1970-2000) climate simulations
downscaled using LOCA. For the control baseline we pooled daily LOCA simulations
from both CCSM4 and GFDL-CM3.

##### SWG Evaluation
Accuracy of the SWGs in representing the climatology of the model-scenario
combinations is critical to draw conclusions from the water level impacts.
Synthetic weather sets were compared on a seasonal basis to the daily LOCA
projections. For each season in each simulation the synthetic data were compare
to the LOCA daily projections for the same season using a two-sided
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine if the distributions of the datasets match.
A two-tailed *t*-test was also performed across the same partitioning to examine
if the means of the two datasets were not significantly different. We expected
to find that approximately 2000 of these comparisons would be determined to be
significantly different as we are testing with $\alpha=0.05$. By conditioning
the precipitation on the previous day's precipitation we could expect to find a
representation of wet and dry spell length and distribution [@wilks-1999]. As
the region has a relatively homogeneous distribution of precipitation without
regular prolonged wet and dry spells the SWG model outputs were not evaluated
for this variable.

### Results

#### SWG Performance

Synthetic weather generator performance can be evaluated by comparing generated
weather sequences with the underlying observed/simulated climate data. The
summary statistics of the sequences should align well with underlying data and
the distribution of observed values should closely match the shape of the
underlying data [@gregory-1993]. When comparing all of the simulated SWG data
(10000 years) the mean values and interquartile ranges of daily minimum and
maximum temperature and precipitation align well with the LOCA-generated daily
values (Table \@ref(tab:swg-check-table)). Fewer monthly precipitation total
outliers were observed for the SWG synthetic series than the LOCA climatology.
Minimum and maximum temperatures showed an increase in outliers in the synthetic
weather series for JJA and SON seasons, and a decrease in outliers for the DJF
and MAM seasons. The difference in outliers was small and may be partially
explained by the scale of the two datasets. The LOCA data represents 30 years of
data compared to the 10,000 years of synthetic weather series. To compare the
SWG and LOCA values as climatologies, we randomly sampled 30 sets of 30 years
from the observed 10,000 synthetic series. The distribution of these samples
were compared to the distribution of LOCA values in Figure
\@ref(fig:swg-check-plot). Figure \@ref(fig:swg-check-plot)A shows good
agreement for all seasons for daily minimum and maximum temperature. The
distribution of simulated monthly precipitation totals are shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:swg-check-plot)B. Relative to minimum and maximum temperature, monthly
precipitation totals show greater variability among the 30 sets of 30-year
synthetic weather series. All three variables show that the synthetic weather
climatologies cluster around the LOCA value as a mean.

#### Wetland Water Level Model Performance
# Need to update this based on reduced set of models
Wetland water level model performance was evaluated using the retained
independent testing datasets. We calculated *R^2^* as a metric for the
relationship between observed and modeled values. *R^2^* cannot be used to
evaluate the accuracy of the models because consistent over or under predictions
would still result in high *R^2^* values [@krause-2005]. We use the median
prediction error to measure model bias and the root median squared error 
(RMedSE) to assess overall predictive accuracy. RMedSE was used in place of RMSE 
becuase we expect some outlier errors where regionally-informed rainfall records 
do not match observed wetland rainfall. In addition to the
overall accuracy of the models we want the models to accurately capture the
hydrologic dynamics of interest (inundation, connectivity, and drawdown). We
tested the predicted probabilities of inundation, connectivity, and drawdown to
the observed probabilities of the same conditions.

Two sites, 113 and 119, had more than 50% of the withheld training years with
*R^2^* below 0.6, which was chosen as a threshold for unsatisfactory model
results by @moriasi-2015 (Figure \@ref(fig:model-metrics)). Site 135 had much
higher errors than all other sites excluding 113. Results from wetland model
performance and simulation data from these sites have been excluded from further
analysis due to consistently the poor performance in the test data. Based on
knowledge of these sites the authors believe these sites would require different
hydrologic process models. Site 119 is a closed basin with no surface outlet and
was shown to have different source water characteristics than other sites
[@vangrinsven-2017]. Site 113 has multiple defined seeps which provide direct
surface water inputs to the site. Site 135 is the driest of all study sites and
unlike other sites has only infrequent and localized surface water.

**Add panel labels**

```{r model-metrics, fig.cap="Wetland model performance metrics. Metrics were calculated for each site-year combination and are presented within sites. RMedSE and rRMedSE are root median squared error and root median squared error relative to wetland water level range within that year.

Site characteristics suggest that the outlier sites would require new hydrologic models."}

```

Table \@ref(tab:model-metrics) summarizes the wetland model metrics by site
status after the above outlier sites were removed, presenting the minimum,
maximum, and median values observed across all site-year combinations. Median
model performance was the same between site statuses for *R^2* and rRMedSE
(\@ref(tab:model-metrics)). The treated models showed lower median values for
median error and RMedSE (\@ref(tab:model-metrics)). For the remaining sites
*R^2* values ranged from -0.10 to 0.98. The one observed negative *R^2* value
occurred at an extremely wet site (157) which generally shows very little
drawdown, resulting in magnified relative errors (Figure
\@ref(fig:model-metrics)A & D).

    autonum = officer::run_autonum(seq_id = "tab", bkm = "model-metrics"))


```

Modeled wetland water levels showed no significant difference in probability of
ecohydrologically significant water levels (Table \@ref(tab:pred_probs)). The
range of site-level probability of each level of interest were similar between
modeled and observed data (Figure \@ref(fig:predicted-probabilities)). Though
non-significant these results show a systematic bias towards drier conditions in
the modeled wetland water levels. All comparisons of current conditions to
combinations of future vegetation conditions and climate scenarios will use
modeled current conditions. This comparison ensures that the described
non-significant model bias does not impact results or conclusions. It also sets
equal sample sizes between the control and future conditions.

```

#### Wetland Water Levels

Wetland water levels under future climate conditions were highly variable under
both scenarios and both vegetation types (Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)).
Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact) shows the probability that wetland water levels
will be above or below the ecohydrologically relevant thresholds defined above.
The reported probability is the proportion of observations where daily water
level surpasses each threshold out of all modeled daily water levels in a month
(~30,000). The median probability and a range representing 67% of all
observations (highest density continuous intervals, HDCI) are shown as point and
line estimates for the less and more sensitive future climate scenarios. Modeled
control conditions are also reported as the median and 67% HDCI, represented as
a crossbar and shaded area.

For non-forested conditions both future climate scenarios showed a decrease in
probability of connectivity relative to current site conditions (Figure
\@ref(fig:total-impact)A). The more sensitive climate scenario consistently
showed a lower median probability of connectivity and was more likely to have
simulated conditions outside of the HDCI of current conditions. The
less-sensitive climate scenario showed greatest agreement with current conditions
in July and August. Future forested conditions were more likely to show
connectivity in July and August under both climate scenarios, to a greater
degree under the less sensitive climate scenario (Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)B).
Connectivity to the larger hydrologic network was much less likely to occur
under the more sensitive climate scenario and both vegetation conditions in May
(Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)A & B). Under both vegetation conditions the
more-sensitive climate scenario resulted in a lower probability of connectivity
relative to the less-sensitive climate scenario. While both vegetation conditions
showed significant overlap between the less-sensitive climate conditions and
control conditions, the non-forested conditions tended to skew towards current
drier years (lower probability of connectivity) and future forested conditions
skewed towards current wetter years (high probability of connectivity).

Inundation results in Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)C & D closely resemble the
patterns observed in the connectivity results. This is inline with fit model
parameters that showed maximum sustained water levels were above the surface for
almost every wetland and treatment combination (**TABLE S1**). Generally,
inundated conditions would be less prevalent under future non-forested
conditions than the future-forested conditions. For non-forested conditions
there was less overlap between observed conditions and the more-sensitive
climate scenario results (Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)D). This was contrary
to non-forested conditions where the less-sensitive climate scenario results
showed more overlap with current conditions. Under both future climate scenarios
(Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)C). Future-forested conditions showed increased
probability for inundation in July, August, and September (Figure
\@ref(fig:total-impact)D).

The probability that water levels will drop to less than 50 cm below the wetland
soil surface agree with the connectivity and inundation results (Figure
\@ref(fig:total-impact)E & F). Under both climate scenarios the future forest
conditions showed a lower probability of drawdown than was observed under the
current black ash forest, with almost no overlap with current conditions in
July, August, and September (Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)F). Drawdown events
were very unlikely under replacement forested conditions under both climate
scenarios. Probability of drawdown was greater in the more sensitive scenario
relative to the less sensitive scenario and also more variable. Under the
non-forest cover the probability of drawdown was more likely under both future
climate scenarios. Differences from current conditions were greatest in August,
but drawdown conditions were much more likely than current conditions from July
through October (Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)E).

```{r total-impact, fig.cap="Probability of observing water levels above (connectivity, inundation) or below (drawdown) ecohydrologically significant thresholds. Points represent median the median observed probability within a month and ranges represent 67% of the simulations as highest-density continuous interval (HDCI). Gray shaded area represents model simulations for control black (ash forest) conditions under the current climate and the black bar represents the control monthly median probability."}

### Discussion

#### SWG

Our SWG performed well at simulating weather series that conformed to LOCA-
downscaled future climate scenarios (Table \@ref(tab:swg-check-table)}, Figure 
\@ref(fig:swg-check-plot)). The synthetic weather series were well aligned with 
the LOCA series, with precipitation showing more inter-simulation variability 
than minimum or maximum temperature. This result is understandable when we 
consider that in the study region precipitation is only weakly seasonal, while 
minimum and maximum temperature have strong seasonal signals. For the downscaled 
LOCA values the CV of the seasonal-mean precipitation was 0.24 cm and was 
3.45 and 0.75 &deg;C for the seasonal-mean minimum and maximum temperatures, 
respectively. There may be a slight trend in under estimating the range of 
observed future climate conditions (Table \@ref(tab:swg-check-table)). This is 
likely a result of reversion to the seasonal mean due to a lack of available 
external weather drivers. Under future climate scenarios extreme events are 
expected to be more common place (**CITATION**), and these results suggest that 
could be better parameterized by increasing the probability of extreme events 
through selection of distribution choices and modeling framework (@verdin-2019). 
This shortcoming of the SWGs should not affect our findings because our
objective is not to model response to extreme events, but overall probability of
certain threshold water levels. These water levels will be affected by extreme
precipitation events but the systems do not have infinite storage and more
extreme events can be expected to pulse through the system more quickly
(**CITATION**). The quicker the pulse passes through the system the smaller the
impact on overall probability of wetland water levels maintaining above a
certain level.

We chose to use an SWG approach that relied on only a single estimate of climate 
within the study area. Alternatively, regional variation in climate and 
weather patterns could be incorporated by using additional meteorological 
stations in the development of the SWG. A spatially-explicit SWG approach 
takes into account the covariance of regional meteorological stations and has 
been shown to faithfully capture larger regional trends in climate and weather 
(@verdin-2015). Within our study region there are no clear weather or climate 
gradients and so we assumed that each study wetland was within a single 
climatic unit. This results in a much simpler SWG-construction process, but the 
resulting SWG cannot be used outside of the study region without reconstruction 
from a different meteorological station(s). To simulate black ash wetland 
response on a regional basis would require addressing known temperature and 
precipitation gradients through the range of black ash. 

In addition to using only a single spatial representation of future climate, we
chose to use individual years of simulation. The direct impact of this is to
missing long-term droughts and wet spells. These events are expected to increase
in frequency under future climate scenarios (**CITATION**). We deliberately
chose to use single-year simulations because of the length of available training
data. During our study the region was in the process of transitioning from a
relatively dry period to a relatively wetter period (\@ref{fig:water-balacne}).
Our training data are primarily drawn from the drier portion of the study
period. Without longer-periods of training data we do not feel that we can
capture both the intra- and inter-annual dynamics of wetland hydrology. If we
assumed all 10000 years of synthetic weather series were contiguous weather
records, the longest period of drought years (annual precipitation less than
annual PET) was 7 and 9 years for the less and more sensitive climate scenarios,
respectively. By using single-year simulations we are implicitly assuming that
fall and winter (SON and DJF) precipitation is high enough to recharge the local
hydrology driving these wetlands, restarting the cycle at or near maximum
wetland water levels. When we consider only fall and winter precipitation we
found 0%, 8.7%, and 10.1% of synthetic weather series had totals below the tenth
percentile of observed data, less-sensitive, and more-sensitive climate
scenarios, respectively. Unsurprisingly close to 10% of the synthetic weather
winters were drier than the tenth percentile of the LOCA downscaled values.
Synthetic (and LOCA) winters were wetter than observed winters, supporting the
assumption that dormant-season precipitation would be enough to recharge wetland
water levels.

#### Ecosystem Specific Yield

The approach used to calculate *E~Sy~* for use in relating the magnitude of
water level change to the drivers of that change was an alternative to those
presented in previous research. We developed this alternative based on
unsuccessful attempts to implement *E~Sy~* calculates through the rainfall/rise
method described in McLaughlin, et al (-@mclaughlin-2014). Directly proving the
accuracy of this approach is outside the scope of this study, and would be best
performed through theoretical and designed experimental work. Our research has
however provided empirical evidence for the application of our approach. Section
CASE_STUDY in Chapter TRANSDUCER_ERRORS demonstrates that *ET* estimates derived
using this approach perform comparably to other implementations for calculating
*E~Sy~* (see White method details above). Those results showed that calculated
*ET* was correlated with daily *PET* estimates from nearby meteorological
stations. In this work we can look at how well a simple regression between daily
water level change and adjusted or unadjusted hydrologic drivers perform. Figure
\@ref(fig:esy-impact) shows the results of a quantile regression (not used
elsewhere in this study) explaining daily change in wetland water level as a
function of *PET* *P* and *M*. We found that *R<sup>2</sup>* of the model
improved from 0.69 to 0.78. While 0.69 is considered an acceptable *R^2^* as set
out in Moriasi (-@moriasi-2015), we can see that water level drawdown is
extremely underestimated by the unadjusted model (Figure
\@ref(fig:esy-impact)A). Our results show that periods with the highest drawdown
are not correctly modeled using the raw inputs. These periods of high drawdown
are captured when the *E~Sy~* adjusted hydrologic inputs are used. Periods of
high drawdown generally occurred mid-season when water levels were farther below
the surface. Our approach agrees with others (**CITATIONS**) finding that the
impact of *E~Sy~* increases as water levels drawdown and that flooded conditions
approach an *E~Sy~* of 1 (CITATION). This relationship results in the largest
adjustment to inputs during these mid-season periods, explaining the differences
seen between panels A and B in Figure \@ref(fig:esy-impact). These results
together with those in Section CASE_STUDY in Chapter TRANSDUCER_ERRORS provide
empirical evidence that this alternative formulation captures the variation of
*E~Sy~* with wetlands and can be used in scenarios where the rainfall-runoff
ratio approach is masked by outside influences such as low-frequency hydrologic
signals (@zhu-2011) and surface water connectivity (@watras-2017).

What if the response of black ash transpiration to lowering water levels (rapid 
increase in T) is actually the signal I am capturing, not *E~Sy~*? This may be 
partly hapeening, but the response between rainfall and water level response is 
well explained by the current *E~Sy~* response, suggesting that the modeled 
phenomenon is primarily *E~Sy~*.

#### Wetland Water Level Models

  by = .(site_status)]
-->

Wetland model performance was adequate for the objective of this study, which
was to observe changes in the hydrographs of black ash wetlands and compare the
probability of critical ecohydrological water levels occurring. Overall the
retained models showed good correlation between observed and modeled water
levels (Figure \@ref(fig:model-metrics)A, Table \@ref(tab:model_metrics)). We
found that 80% and 100% of site-year combinations outside of sites 119 and 156
had *R^2* values above 0.6 for the control and treated condition models,
respectively. Model performance varied by site with a median rRMedSE of 12.75%
(Control: 13.03%, Treated: 12.58%) of annual water level range and median model
error was -2.19 cm (Control: -1.93 cm, Treated: -2.28 cm). RMedSE and relative
RMedSE had similar patterns among sites (Figure \@ref(fig:model-metrics)). This
suggests that from both absolute and relative standpoint, the wetland models as
developed capture dynamic wetland water levels more accurately than static
wetland water levels. Daily percent bias estimates (PBIAS) would be helpful to
evaluate error relative to observed daily water level. However, wetland water
levels cross 0 so that the relative error approaches infinity as water levels
rise or fall towards the surface.

The wetland models performed well predicting the probability of occurrence of
important hydroecological water levels. Table \@ref(tab:predicted-probs) and
Figure \@ref(fig:predicted-probabilities) show how probability of occurrence of
connectivity, inundation, and drawdown were not found to be different between
the observed and modeled data in the test periods. They also show that there is
no non-significant systematic model bias (positive or negative). Although no
systematic model bias was identified, use a modeled control baseline is still an 
important safeguard against drawing conclusions based on potential from model
artefacts. Comparing the systematically-biased results could exaggerate or mask 
real expectation of wetter or drier wetland conditions.

The next step for these models is to fit them using a hierarchical Bayesian
approach. This should improve model fit by incorporating information from all
sites into a single model for each vegetation condition while still allowing
model parameters to vary between sites. It will also increase the available data
for model fitting as unbalanced vegetation-conditions would be accounted for in
the structure of the model. If model performance does not significantly improve
with that approach more, or potentially all years of data can be used to
parameterize the wetland models. Using most or all of the data for model
parameterization precludes the options of evaluating model performance on truly
independent data. Kozak and Kozak (-@kozak-2003) provide an alternative view
that replaces cross-validation with lack-of-fit metrics, which evaluate model
predictions for assumptions of model assumptions. Their main conclusion was that
cross-validation increase the variance of model estimates potentially resulting
in poor model choice.

#### Future Hydrology

The importance of these simulation results is to help relate potential future
simulations to current conditions in dry, wet, or 'normal' years. This allows
researchers and managers to answer questions similar to: What will these sites
look like in a 'normal' year in the future? How will these sites respond to
wet/dry conditions in the future? For example, we could expect that during a wet
year under the more sensitive future climate scenario a non-forested wetland on
these sites would have a similar probability of surface inundation as a black
ash wetland does today (Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact)C). In general, black ash
wetlands that become non-forested can be expected to be have wetter conditions
under less- sensitive future climate scenarios, and under more-sensitive future
climate scenarios are more likely to experience conditions similar to today.
Conclusions could be reached for each combination of climate and vegetaiton
scenario and this information can and should be used to influence management
approaches and timing in responding to EAB in black ash wetlands.

The combined impact of EAB and climate can be seen by comparing the future 
climate conditions (blue and orange) to the control conditions under historical 
climate (shaded gray) in Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact). We can draw 
additional information about the individual effects of future climate and 
vegetative cover on wetlands by altering how we calculate the baseline. In 
Figure \@ref(fig:total-impact) the baseline is to simulated black ash forests
under current climate conditions. To isolate the effects of each climate 
scenario of wetland hydrology we can compare the response of a vegetative under 
future climate conditions against its response under current climate conditions. 
Conversely we can evaluate the impact of vegetative cover by comparing each 
vegetative cover to simulated black ash forests under current climate conditions. 
Figures \@ref(fig:climate-impact) and \@ref(fig:eab-impact) show the 
probability of occurrence of each critical ecohydrological water level under 
conditions where the vegetative cover and climate, respectively, are held 
constant. Table \@ref(tab:impact-attribution) presents the change in probability 
of occurrence for each critical water level and alternative vegetative condition 
that can be attributed to EAB or a less or more sensitive future climate 
scenario.

We found that EAB impacts lead to slightly wetter conditions under non-forested
conditions and the present climate. This agrees with observed water level
response analysis in Van Grinsven, et al (-@vangrinsven-2017), where absolute
water level response to simulated post-EAB conditions resulted in wetter
conditions and significantly lower growing season drawdown rates. A modeled
alternate forest composition (Future Forested) shows that EAB impact alone would
lead to dramatically wetter conditions relative to black ash forests. This
result is expected as we modeled our future forested conditions based on
previous work showing that co-dominant hardwoods had significantly lower
seasonal transpiration estimates than black ash (@shannon-2017). Under both
alternative vegetative conditions we found that the isolated impact of future
climate scenarios would lead to much drier sites. The probability of surface
water connectivity or inundation occurring are dramatically decreased under both
climate scenarios. The probability of wetland water levels dropping below 50 cm
were increased under future climate scenarios for the non-forested conditions,
but showed little change for non-forested conditions.

Our hypothesis that the impacts of EAB and climate change would counteract each
other is partially supported by our hypothesis. The dynamics of wetland water
levels are complex (**CITATION**) climate change and invasive species can each
have major consequences (**CITATIONS**). We can summarize our findings by saying
we expect wetlands that transition from black ash forests to non-forested sites
to become drier, primarily due to the effects of increased summer evaporative demand (Figures \@ref(fig:total-impact) &
\@ref(fig:future-climate), Table \@ref(tab:impact-attribution)). Our simulations saw less summer precipitation under the less sensitive scenario, while under the more sensitive scenario we obseved an increase in large storms (Figure \@ref(fig:future-climate). If management
or natural regeneration leads to establishment of future forests with lower site
transpiration rates, these wetlands can be expected to have the occurrence of high water
conditions remain stable or increase in frequency, while dry conditions (water
levels more than 50 cm below the surface) become more rare (Figures
\@ref(fig:total-impact) & \@ref(fig:future-climate), Table
\@ref(tab:impact-attribution)). Our results show that the impact of climate 
change in this region will lead to consistently drier wetland conditions. Changes to vegetative cover 
can amplify or counteract hydrologic alterations attributable to climate 
change.

<!--
The high interannual variability of these systems does not show much
differentiation between climate scenarios and vegetation conditions. Examining
the probability of occurrence of certain threshold water levels does show
differentiation between climate scenarios and vegetation conditions. Similar to 
how interannual differences and hydrologic drivers masked treatment effects in 
raw water level signal.

Wetland water levels under observed conditions were highly variable
[@vangrinsven-2017] similar to simulations.

Discuss skew of distributions. Some months (check panel C in probs figure) exhibit more positive or negative 
skew in the observed probabilities.

Observed water levels are highly variable so it's not surprising that future 
conditions are also highly variable.

#### Drivers of Future Wetland Hydrology

LOCA-downscaled climate simulations for the study region showed 

It is expected that vegetation conditions with lower transpiration rates have
lower rates of water level drawdown and therefore lower increased water levels.
In these wetlands this effect is compounded by the dynamics of *E~Sy~*. *E~Sy~*
increases in magnitude as water levels decline (Figure @\ref(fig:esy-function)),
which may be a result of reduced soil pore space and wetland cross-sectional
area so that a smaller volume of change results in a large water level
difference (**CITATIONS**). The effect is that *PET* results in smaller changes
to wetland water levels under wet conditions than dry conditions. In this way
the impact of EAB may lead to a feedback loop in which water levels remain
elevated:

1. *AET* begins to draw down water levels, *E~Sy~* is low,  
2. Water levels decline slowly because of reduced *AET* and low *E~Sy~*,  
3. *E~Sy~* is lower than under black ash as *PET* increases to mid-season peak,  
4. High *PET* impact on water levels are reduced by lower *AET* and sustained 
low *E~Sy~*.  

Under the current black ash conditions *E~Sy~* increases more rapidly
due to higher black ash *AET*. The increase in *E~Sy~* accelerates the impact of
higher *AET*, creating faster and larger declines in wetland water level
throughout the growing season. This feedback loop may partially explain the
persistence of hydrologic impact following EAB disturbance observed in Michigan 
and Minnesota [@diamond-2018; @kolka-2018]. In effect, the impact of EAB may 
shock these systems into an alternative stable state of elevation water levels 
[@scheffer-2003]. Our results indicate that future climate scenarios will likely 
have a large enough impact to again shock these systems out of a stable state. 
We cannot say from these simulations whether the wetlands will reach a 
new stable state under future climate conditions or what that state would be.

Make sure talking about PET and P of future climates vs current climate in 
reference to future-climate figure

We observed wetter conditions observed under our Future Forest simulations
relative to both Black Ash and Non-Forested simulations under all climate
scenarios (Figures \@ref(fig:predicted-probabilities), \@ref(fig:eab-impact)).
Two factors are likely contributing to this result. The first is that our future
forest composition is known to have lower transpiration rates than the existing
black ash canopy [@shannon-2018]. As a model choice we opted to assume that the
next most dominant canopy species would be the likely replacement canopy
species. The future forest we modeled is a narrow range of potential future
forest compositions. natural regeneration or planting efforts may lead to future
forested species composition that more closely matches the evaporative potential
of the current black ash canopy. Secondly, the future forested conditions may
have a lower total *AET* than the non-forested conditions. In black ash wetlands
in Minnesota simulated post-EAB conditions (girdled and standing ash) were found
to have higher water levels than site were the ash stems were harvested and
removed [@diamond-2018]. The authors attributed the result to limited *AET*
leading to reduced solar energy and wind-driven boundary layer mixing due to the
still standing stems. Our conditions have a notable difference from that study
in that we are assuming there are living trees on site. However a closed canopy
would have the same effect of reducing open water evaporation and understory
transpiration. With suffificiently reduced canopy transpiration the effect of
certain forest compositions could result in reduced overall *AET*. This was
observed in reverse in northern Minnesota when total *AET* increased after
low-transpiration black spruce was removed from a peatland (**CITATION**).

The contrast between the Non-Forested and Future-Forested simulated hydrology
suggests an important management tool. Iverson et al [-@iverson-2016] and the
work from Bolton [-@bolton-2018] and Looney [-@looney-2015] laid out a framework
and results for evaluating potential replacement species considering site
conditions of black ash wetlands. The results presented here show the
opportunity for management decisions that take into account the impact of future
vegetation on site hydrologic conditions. The general trend of drier future
conditions can be to some degree counteracted by management for cover with lower
evapotranspiration rates. This tactic could be used to retain water on the
landscape, creating refugia of standing water or cool moist soils for flora and
fauna.

### Future Research

It should be stated that these models and simulations cannot capture the full
range of potential changes from EAB, other potential invasive species, and
climate change. The following is a non-exhaustive list of further known
assumptions within this analysis that could warrant further study.

- @watras-2014 found that there are decadal scale oscillations of water levels 
within the Great Lakes and inland lakes in the Great Lakes Region. These can be 
expected to impact wetland water levels similarly.  
- While our results showed a smaller and earlier snowmelt pulse (TODO: output figure)
we did not attempt to model the more complex dynamics of rain-on-snow events and 
a compressed melting period reducing recharge to the intermediate groundwater 
sources shown to feed these wetlands [**snowmetl citation**, **GROUNDWATER CITATION** @vangrinsven-2017].  
- Our single-year simulations do not account for the potential effects of 
multi-year drought or for periods of significantly reduced fall/winter 
precipitation on wetland water level rebound.  
- The response of each species and plant community will show individual climate
change responses that are not captured in these models and may be non-linear
[@short-2016].  

Beyond the potential for unforeseen vegetation responses to future climates is 
the uncertainty of future climate conditions. The authors of the fourth 
national climate assessment have highlighted that early climate prediction have 
under-predicted contemporary shifts in response to climate change 
(**CITATION**). Unfortunately this means that our models built on those 
simulations may be underestimating the magnitude of future changes.

Wetlands provide a range of ecological services from water quality and stormflow
retention to carbon storage, all of which stand to be impacted by climate change
[@moomaw-2018]. We did not attempt to quantify how changes in wetland hydrology 
will influence these other services. By highlighting the magnitude and drivers 
of hydrologic change in these systems we hope to spur future research.

### Conclusions

Our research has shown that changes in evaporative demand and precipitation
regimes will likely result in drier conditions on what are now black ash
wetlands. In addition the functional loss of black ash due to EAB presents 
challenges and opportunities for the future of these wetlands. A large extent of 
forested wetlands may require intervention to retain desired benefits or 
features they currently provide. These interventions can be used to drive sites 
towards wetter conditions, retaining water on the landscape that may otherwise 
be lost under a changing climate.  

To implement long-term management objectives in wetland and forest management 
requires a deep understanding of the systems. We have shown that as water levels 
decline, the impact of each additional driver increases due to changes in
*E~Sy~*. Changes in *AET* can interact with *E~Sy~* to create feedback loops 
underscoring that knowledge of species adaptation to wet conditions and capacity 
to respond quickly to drying conditions is critical for projected future site 
conditions. The transition from black ash to alternative vegetative cover can 
counteract or amplify the impacts of future conditions with higher evaporative 
demand. And the relationship between evaporative demand and *E~Sy~* can amplify 
the effect of wetland water level drawdown.
