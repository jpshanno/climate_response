## Presentation Overview
Not just an outline of the presentation (Should be graphical: flowchart like
showing map of MI/Ash Importance, zoom in on wetlands, show three big drivers (EAB, Climate,
Mgmt), end with question about what it means). 
Present broad methodology overview 'I ran *statistical wetland
simulations* under current climate and future climate conditions to study the
interactions of invasive species, climate change, and forest management
decisions on forested wetland ecosystems'

**Great Lakes Regional Changes**
- 3.5-8 $^oC$ increase in annual temperatures & 0-25% increase in annual precipitation  
- Temperature increase more dramatic in winter
- Precipitation increasing in winter & spring, decreasing in the summer
- Changes will impact black ash habitat suitability

## Data Collection
.pull-left[
- 14 black ash wetlands in Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan (map of Great Lakes)
- Site monitoring began in 2012
- Simulated EAB infestation in winter 2013-2014
- Treatment decreased water level drawdown & increased late summer water levels
- Strong local/intermediate groundwater (snow-dominated) signal through the growing season

## Wetland Model Validation
- Might be able to do validations based on simulations from observed data

## Future Climate Weather Series
.pull-left[
- GFDL-CM3, RCP 8.5
- 2070-2099
- Daily time-step precipitation and min/max temperature over $\frac{1}{16}^{\mathsf{o}}$ grid through LOCA (Localized Constructed Analogs) downscaling
- Sample of 100 grid cells within the study region for a total of 3000 years of simulated
weather conditions

Current selection is for a sensitive model under the most ?extreme?
representative concentration pathway
- Figure from @byun-2018  
- LOCA downscaled daily projections  
- Future climate used years from 2070-2099  
- Selected 100 pixel time series from the study area to serve as 3000 annual 
weather sequences

# Results under Current Climate
- Run each site under control & treatment models
**FOUR PANELS OF BEST PERFORMING MODELS88
```{r}

```

# Results under Future Climate


???
- Define wetland morphology groups

---
# Comparison of Results
- Compare within treatment between climates  
- Compare difference between treatments given climate  
- Any wet year vs dry year differences?
- Need to at least have basic met differences between simulations if any 
water level differences are present

---
# Compare Climate Sequences



---
## Future Work
- Bookend climate simulation selection - Current selection represents more
sensitive model and least control on emissions. Next will represent less
sensitive model  
- Improve Model through Rigorous Validation  
- Move from LOCA-projected daily values to spatially-explicit SWG with forcing
from LOCA-projections  
- Transition from discrete models to a distribution of possible parameters to 
capture a wider range of variation
- Compare my work with Iverson
- Incorporate snow melt timing into drawdown

???
- Improve from water_availability (need to get it from January 1st)
- Incorporate ARIMA components
